For a long time the abortion argument has been causing dissension in the American public. And just like the American public, the abortion arguments has morphed into an almost purely partisan issue. Pontifical pronouncements, riddled with fallacies and pathos have become to go to arguments, with each side throwing ??? accusations - left wingers have become "Baby killers" and right wingers "Sexist facists" (altough it would appear that nowadays any opinion which is not left wing is facist).

And therein lies the problem- if one side are facists and the other are baby killers, it is impossible to settle this debate. There is no middle ground, you can't only "somewhat kill a baby", you either kill a baby or not. You either support an ideology of racial superiority and genocide or not. As long as the abortion debate is "baby killers vs. facists", it cannot be solved. Fortunately, it doesn't have to be this way.

There is a way, and a rather simple one, to get back on track- using logic. If we were to turn the abortion debate into a philosophical debate, arguments like "baby killers" can't be thrown around, first they need to be proven. Arguments such as "facists" will be meaningless- it's just an ad hominem. 

## The Rules ##

In order to make this switch, we first need to agree on some groundrules:

1. **No religion.** You can't use religion in this debate for a number of reasons: 
    
    - Begging the question fallacy - in order to use religion in an arguments, you first have you prove its validity, or in other words- to prove no only the existence of god, but that your religion is the true religion out of thounsands of religions. This is a completely different debate, one which hasn't been settled for thousands of years. It would simply be replacing one unsolvable issue with another. 
    - Anyone can make up their own religion and claim it not only permits abortions but encourages them, which really infantalizes the debate.
    - You can't use an illogical idealogy (or one that is "beyond logic"), based in blind faith, a belief, in a logical debate. It contradicts the very nature of the debate.
2. **Definitions are everything.** When learning math you understand the important of the definition- you can't prove something which you cannot define. Vague definitions make it an impossible task to make a valid point. If you can't define the word baby, how can you prove that abortion is killing or not killing babies? 
Every definition has to be precise. For example, if you define a vehicle as "an something capable of moving", it's a bad definition- humans fit this description and we are not vehicles. You need to be more specific. But not two specific- "A means of carrying or transporting something which uses wheels" doesn't include trains or boats.
3. **A consice, achievable goal.** Every debate must have a predetermined, mutually agreed upon goal, and one that can be achieved. If your goal is to convice people, to be right, to prove wrong- it's a bad goal. You don't care about the truth, about the good of the women or babies, just about your feeling of superioirty. If your goal is to prove that your oponents are facists or baby killers, it's bad goals. You'll be having two simultaneous speeches, not a conversation. You simply won't be on the same page, and it's impossible to reach an agreement this way. 
You need to be open minded, willing to change your mind. You need to try and find out the truth.

## The Argument ##

After we set some groundrules, it's time to start. I feel that biggest issue with abortion is the "baby killers" argument. If abortion is really killing babies, we can't allow this to happen. There is a unanimous agreement that killing babies is wrong. However, if abortion is not killing babies, than the pro-life case essentially crumbles. 

The way I see it, the killing part is pretty obvious- you cease the life of a living creature, that's killing. And obviously there is no debate whether or not a fetus is alive as it is in essence a bunch of living cells. The problem is the baby part- it's not a baby, it's a fetus, an embryo, a zigot. A baby is what the fetus become **after birth**, not before. Therefore, you cannot abort a baby, and abortion can't be considered the killing of babies. 

However, there is a more reasonable point in this arguments- killing a fetus is the same as killing a baby. Both are human offspring and deserve the same treatment accordingly.
