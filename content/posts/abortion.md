For a long time, the abortion argument has been causing dissension in the American public. And just like the American public, the abortion arguments has morphed into an almost purely partisan issue. Pontifical pronouncements, riddled with fallacies and pathos have become to go-to arguments, with each side throwing ??? accusations - left-wingers have become "Baby killers" and right-wingers "Sexist fascists" (although it would appear that nowadays any opinion which is not left-wing is fascist).

And therein lies the problem- if one side are fascists and the other are baby killers, it is impossible to settle this debate. There is no middle ground, you can't only "somewhat kill a baby", you either kill a baby or not. You either support an ideology of racial superiority and genocide or not. As long as the abortion debate is "baby killers vs. fascists", it cannot be solved. Fortunately, it doesn't have to be this way.

There is a way, and a rather simple one, to get back on track- using logic. If we were to turn the abortion debate into a philosophical debate, arguments like "baby killers" can't be thrown around; first, they need to be proven. Arguments such as "fascists" will be meaningless- it's just an ad hominem. 

## The Rules ##

In order to make this switch, we first need to agree on some ground rules:

1. **No religion.** You can't use religion in this debate for several reasons: 
    
    - Begging the question fallacy - to use religion in an argument, you first have you prove its validity, or in other words- to prove no only the existence of God, but that your religion is the true religion out of thousands of religions. This is a completely different debate, one which hasn't been settled for thousands of years. It would simply be replacing one unsolvable issue with another. 
    - Anyone can make up their own religion and claim it not only permits abortions but encourages them, which really infantilizes the debate.
    - You can't use an illogical idealogy (or one that is "beyond logic"), based in blind faith, a belief, in a logical debate. It contradicts the very nature of the debate.
2. **Definitions are everything.** When learning math you understand the importance of the definition- you can't prove something which you cannot define. Vague definitions make it an impossible task to make a valid point. If you can't define the word baby, how can you prove that abortion is killing or not killing babies? 
Every definition has to be precise. For example, if you define a vehicle as "a something capable of moving", it's a bad definition- humans fit this description and we are not vehicles. You need to be more specific. But not two specific- "A means of carrying or transporting something which uses wheels" doesn't include trains or boats.
3. **A concise, achievable goal.** Every debate must have a predetermined, mutually agreed-upon goal, and one that can be achieved. If your goal is to convince people, to be right, to prove wrong- it's a bad goal. You don't care about the truth, about the good of the women or babies, just about your feeling of superiority. If your goal is to prove that your opponents are fascists or baby killers, it's bad goals. You'll be having two simultaneous speeches, not a conversation. You simply won't be on the same page, and it's impossible to reach an agreement this way. 
You need to be open-minded, willing to change your mind. You need to try and find out the truth.

## The Argument ##

After we set some ground rules, it's time to start. I feel that the biggest issue with abortion is the "baby killers" argument. If abortion really is killing babies, we can't allow this to happen. There is a unanimous agreement that killing babies is wrong. However, if abortion is not killing babies, then the pro-life case essentially crumbles. 

The way I see it, the killing part is pretty obvious- you cease the life of a living creature, that's killing. And obviously, there is no debate whether or not a fetus is alive as it is, in essence, a bunch of living cells. The problem is the baby part- it's not a baby, it's a fetus, an embryo, a zygote. A baby is what the fetus become **after birth**, not before. Therefore, you cannot abort a baby, and abortion can't be considered the killing of babies. 

However, there is a more reasonable point in these arguments- killing a fetus is the same as killing a baby. Both are human offspring and deserve the same treatment accordingly. And since human babies have a right to life, since we deem their life sacred just due to them being humans, then a fetus's life is also sacred and must be protected. It has the same rights every human has.

For us to test this assumption, I will try to define the value of human life. I will try to find out what makes a human's life so precious and sacred? Why is the sanctity of life unassailable? What makes a human's so much more important than, say, a mosquito's, or a dog's? 

For us to get to a precise definition of the value of human life, we'll try to narrow the group of "things" it is wrong to kill and see what makes them unique. Hopefully, we'll find one or more qualities that make them special, and there we might be able to find the value of life. All of the questions assume no immediate danger to life, no abuse or torture (a swift and painless killing).

We'll start by going through a few obvious ones: Is it okay to kill a plant? Yes. Is it okay to kill a mosquitoe or a fly? Yes. A fish? Yes. Now let's take it up a notch: what about a deer, a pig, a wild dog, a dolphin? Yes, but a lot more reluctantly (if you're vegan and think that the answer is no, bear with me. I will address that later.). 
Now, what about a pet dog or cat? That would be a resounding no. So, there is something that makes pet dogs and cats more important, more privileged, than pretty much every other animal. Could it be the pet part? Could the reason be the right to property? I would argue not. We don't care about a pet hamster nearly as much as a pet dog.

Moving on. Now I would like to approach this from a different angle: When does a person stop being himself? Let's say a good friend of yours lost a limb, an arm for example. Is he still your best friend? Is it still the same person? Yes. What about two limbs? Three? All four? Still yes. Sure, he looks different. Hanging out with him is different. But you will still see him as the same person. So we can safely say that the quality that makes someone himself does not lie in his limbs, or more accurately, in his body (broken nose, losing an eye or ear, would lead to the same conclusion).

Let's talk about your childhood friends. When you were in grammar school or kindergarten you probably had friends. Fast forward 20-30 years and I think it's safe to assume you've lost touch about 20-30 years ago. Let's say you came across one of them, would you connect? Aside from a dull catching up conversation, you would probably have nothing in common. You won't consider each other friends anymore. Why? What happened? You two were good friends back then, how come two people just stop being friends? The answer is simple- you've changed, at least one of you (hopefully both of you). You're not the 7-year-old kids you once were. You probably don't have school anymore, and if you do it's a little more advanced than learning how to read (hopefully). You don't watch the same shows, you don't have those same thoughts, you behave and speak differently. However, you probably still care about your friend. Not as much as your current friends, but you still do. 

Think about your best friend. You are probably an adult and it is less likely for you to experience significant transformations personality-wise, making it improbable for you to drift apart. Now let's assume that your best friend starts doing drugs. Heavy drugs, something like heroin or cocaine. It starts as a one-time thing and slowly becomes an everyday thing. He can't hold a job, he can't hold relationships. He starts stealing, gambling. You stop seeing each other, lose contact. Eventually he ODs and dies. You'll miss him, you'll cry at his funeral. 

Here's the question: whom do you miss? Do you miss the drug addict? No, you don't. You miss your best friend, who didn't do any drugs. These are two different people- one was your best friend, the other a drug addict you didn't like. You reminisce of someone long gone. And it's the same with your childhood friend- you care about the kid you used to know a long, long time ago. Not the adult standing in front of you today. 

We can infer that what makes someone himself is in the mind- clearly our body is not what defines us. Changing our physical appearance, be it an amputation or a boob job, doesn't makes us someone else. But changing our mind does- changing our personality, mannerisms, opinions, values - these are the things that define a person. If we change these in a person, we essentially make a new person. 

"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic." is a famous saying, [falsely attributed to Stalin](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/21/death-statistic/), but widely accepted as truth. The people most devastated by the Paris attacks in Nov 2015 were the French. The people most devastated by the 9/11 attacks were the Americans. The emotions Europeans felts after the 2016 Brussels bombings were a lot stronger than those Americans felt. The closer the death to you, the harder it hits home. When you read that the total casualties of WWI are estimated at 40 million, you don't really feel much. Definitely not as much as you felt the day of the Manchester Arena bombing. 
Moreover, reading individual stories of the horrors and heroes of WWI would result in a stronger reaction than reading the big picture stuff. In this case, the whole is not only smaller than the sum of its parts, but every single part is bigger than the whole. We can easily see that it's not the quantity, but the quality.

But what is this quality? There is one last example that can help us understand it. If I were to tell you that someone you don't know, on the other side of the world, has died, would you care? What if I were to tell you his name, Tommy Black, father of 3, grandfather of 2, married for 30 years? You probably care a lot more. What's changed? It's the same person. He's just as dead as he was before. **What's different is that now he is part of our experience.** His life becomes important to us only when he became part of our existence. Just like we don't care about 40 million dead but care about every single one of those, or more accurately- the ones who were on our side. Bad guys deserve to die, we don't really care about them. We don't care that a drug addict died, but we care that our friend has died. Granted, he's been dead for a year, he died the moment he started doing drugs. But we still associate him with his body, we still have hope that he'll come back. Just like we care about our childhood friends, despite them being completely different. **We don't care about people, but of our experience of them.**

When we pull the plug, we are not bothered by killing the one who lies in this hospital bed, someone who for all intents and porpuses is already dead. In our minds, we are killing our memory of him. That what bothers us. That's also the reason why losing an arm doesn't make a different person, become our memory and experience of this person will stay the same, or at least close enough. 40 million people are too abstract, but a name, a face and a story- that's as personal as it gets. That's a memory. And that memory is part of us. The bigger this memory, the bigger the experience, the larger part of us it becomes, the more painful its death is. 

Earlier we found out that this unique quality, the value of life, also exists in pets. More so in dogs than hamsters, definitely more than in wildlife. Now we can explain why- dogs are a big part of our life. They are much more intelligent, thus more unique and significant to our lives. They are around us almost all the time, they are considerably louder. In short- they are a bigger part of our experience, a bigger memory. We play with them, we walk them, we feed them, we pet them. We spend a lot more time with them than other pets. With that being said, hamsters or parrots are still a large part of our experience, which explains why they are still more important to us than wild animals.

So if pets get special treatment for being a part of our experience, why are we upset about killing deers or pigs? After all, they aren't a significant part of the experience. 

Because we still experience them, even for a little while. They are intelligent creatures, significantly more than, say, a bug. While they are not as significant to us as our pets, we still can empathise with them. We can picture ourselves, our pets, in their place. We can see their offspring, we can picture, maybe even feel the pain of a fawn whose mother died. This is an invaluable part of the value of life, it's something that separates deers from insects, pet dogs from pet hamsters, humans from all else- consciousness. The more conscious, the more intelligent the creature is, the more important its life becomes. 

The reason we don't care about killing flies is that their pain, their existence, seems so insignificant and non-existent. We don't see their pain, their emotions, Mainly because they don't have any. However, since a deer can feel pain, is capable of understanding and learning, has some level of consciousness, we can more easily relate to it. It's the same with dogs, whose pain is so much more real, more accessible, than "dumber" pets such as parrots. The best example would be the least developed pet- fish. We don't mind flashing it down the toilet, we often forget to feed it.

This is also the reason why vegetarians care about cows and pigs. They are intelligent, they have some level of consciousness, and that allows us to really experience them. 

To summarize, the value of life resides in two qualities: 
1. We have to experience it, we must have a memory of it, it must be a part of us.
2. It needs to be conscious, hence relatable.

If someone were to kill your grandpa, you would be upset, angry. But why? your grandpa doesn't mind- he's dead. He can't regret it, he can't hurt. You're upset that the murderer took him from you, that you've lost a part of yourself. You won't be remotely as upset if it was a stranger's grandfather, because he is not a part of you. That's also the reason you're not bothered by killing a wild animal as much as you are by the killing of your pet, why the most people feel less passionately about slaughterhouses that vegans- they pity the animals, but the vegans usually watch a lot more videos of the process. It makes it a bigger part of their experience. This means that the experience, to first quality, is much more important than the other. For example, while you would consider the murder of a human being infinitely more morally reprehensible, you would feel more strongly about the murder of your pet. Whereas you'd forget about the murder you read about in the paper within a few minutes, you would grieve your pet for days, weeks, maybe even months. 

From that, we can extrapolate the reason we don't "approve of" murder. The reason we don't want people to murder is that we don't want people to kill our loved ones. If murder is acceptable, it means that people can be taken from us at any given moment. This is the reason we all sign a silent pact- we won't kill you as long as you won't kill us. The pain of losing what is essentially a part of ourselves if too big.


## Back To Abortion ##

Finally, we come back to the subject of this article- abortion. What I set to prove was that a baby and a fetus differ substantially in such a way that as a result of that a fetus doesn't have the same rights or privileges a baby has. Using the definition of the value of life we derived, I believe it becomes evident. 

Here's why: a fetus lacks all of the requirements of a valuable life. 

First of all, it's barely conscious. Sure, it might feel pain after a few weeks, but so can flies and serial killers. It can hear, but so can deers. The further along with the pregnancy it is, the more intelligent it becomes, ergo the more valuable its life. But in the first few weeks, a fetus is closer to a fruit bat than a human baby in terms of consciousness. 

Secondly, it's not part of the experience of any human, other than its mother, and to a lesser extent its family (father, grandparents, siblings, etc.). If the mother is willing to abort the baby, to kill this part of her experience, there would be no harm done to anyone else. And seeing as we have a right to our own body, we can do whatever we want, even if it might cause us harm (be it overeating candies or procrastinating until we flunk out of school). 

In other words, since the value of our life is external, not internal, and since a fetus exists only amongst his mother and close family (assuming they are aware of its existence), as long as the mother deems its life valueless, it is in fact valueless.

In contrast, a baby is not only a very conscious creature, one we can easily relate with but its a part of the experience of its entire family, a rather significant part. The difference between a baby and a fetus in terms of the value of life is so immense, I might even go as far as to call it the biggest difference.

Besides, since a fetus becomes more and more conscious and a bigger part of people's experience the further along with the pregnancy it is, the more valuable its life, hence the harder it is to justify its abortion. By adhering to this definition of the value of life, we can not only determine the morality of abortion, but also its boundaries.
